# Notes
# -----
# 1. Uses a debian based system, not Alpine
# 1. Assumes application is configurable via environment variables,
#    and that there is a single settings.py file
# 1. Assumes Django based application. For Flask, you will delete the collectstatic command. 
#    Also, the wsgi application name in the ENTRYPOINT will also differ slightly.
# 1. This installs Postgres *AND* MySQL in separate steps. 
#    Delete either one or both depending on your use case
# 1. We create a user without any permissions, not even write permissions. This means you cannot 
#    write logs or create directories. You should write logs to stdout / stderr instead.
